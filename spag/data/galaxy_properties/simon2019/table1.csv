# ^b The references listed for each object are for, in order: (1) M_V, (2) R_1/2, (3) distance, (4) v_hel, (5) sigma, (6) [Fe/H], and (7) sigma_[Fe/H].  Inasmuch as the properties of some galaxies have been determined by multiple studies, this reference list is not intended to be complete.  Instead, it represents our assessment of the best available data.  In cases where no velocity and/or metallicity measurements are available in the literature, a dash is listed in place of the corresponding reference.
# ^c Upper limits are at 90% confidence.  Where the original reference does not provide a value at that confidence interval, we have determined one from the data.  Note that upper limits are listed with uncertainties of -9.9.
# ^d No uncertainty on the metallicity dispersion of Carina was provided by Fabrizio et al. (2012).
# ^e No uncertainty on the absolute magnitude of Leo~T was provided by de Jong et al. (2008).
