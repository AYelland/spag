{\footnotesize \tablecomments{To honor the long astronomical traditions in India, Chile, and Australia, we have named the stellar streams presented in this work after aquatic terms and rivers from these regions. The stellar streams in Q1 fall within the Indus constellation and are therefore named after the Indus river and other rivers in India. The streams in Q2 and Q3 are named after rivers in Chile and aquatic terms in native Chilean languages. The streams in Q4 are named for Aboriginal names for Australian rivers.}}
