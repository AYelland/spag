# JINAbase
JINAbase is a database for metal-poor stars originally hosted on a webapp at [jinabase.pythonanywhere.com](https://jinabase.pythonanywhere.com).

:one: updates
-------------
This Webpage provides the most recently added papers to JINAbase. Please note that the formatting in the "JINAbase_2021.csv" is heavily based on the original format of [jinabase.pythonanywhere.com](https://jinabase.pythonanywhere.com).

:two: We are here to help
-------------------------
If you encounter any errors or have any suggestions to help improve the database and the repository please contact us.

:three: TODO
-------------
(1) How to query a table using [Astropy Astronomical Coordinate Systems](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html)

(2) How to query a table using identifiers from the [SIMBAD Astronomical Database](http://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/)

(3) Abundances plotting tutorial: mining the "JINAbase_2021.csv" based on the chemical element of interest.

(4) Adding BibTeX for the references.


:four: Notes on the Table Labels
--------------------------------
Location: 
- HA: MilkyWay halo, BU: MilkyWay bulge, DS: MilkyWay disk, DW: Classical dwarf galaxies, UF: Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, and SC: Stellar clusters.

Stellar types: 
- RG: Giants, SG: Subgiants, HB: Horizontal branch and MS: Main sequence.

Science keys: 
- R1: rI-rich, R2: rII-rich, S: s-rich, RS: r/s-rich and i-rich: i-process rich.

Carbon rich: 
- CEMP: Carbon-rich & neutron-capture-rich, CEMP-no: Carbon-rich but not neutron-capture-rich. C-rich stars with [C/Fe] > 0.7.

(Check Frebel & Norris 2015 for various metal-poor classifications.)
