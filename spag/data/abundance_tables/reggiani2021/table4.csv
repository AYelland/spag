\tablenotetext{a}{We report random uncertainties derived under the
unlikely assumption that the MIST isochrone grid perfectly reproduces
all stellar properties.  There are almost certainly larger systematic
uncertainties that we have not investigated, though the excellent
agreement between our analysis and the results from ASPCAP for the two
stars that are part of both our sample and the SDSS DR16 sample seems
to indicate that any systematic uncertainties in our analysis cannot be
too large.}
