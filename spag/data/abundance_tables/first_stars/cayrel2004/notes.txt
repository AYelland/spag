This data was originally loaded and made to be added to JINAbase.

In "First Stars. V.", the [Fe/H]_c value reported in the stellar 
parameter table is the average of the measured Fe I and Fe II abundnaces.

( [Fe I/H] + [Fe II/H] ) / 2 = [Fe/H]_c

In "First Stars. VIII.", these [Fe/H]_c values are reported as
the true values of iron abundance and used wen calculating [X/Fe]
abundances (alongside Grevesse and Savaul 1998/2000 solar abundances.)

Now, it has been loaded in with the other references, such that it will be added with the other references later on.
