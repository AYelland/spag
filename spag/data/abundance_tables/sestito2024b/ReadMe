Abstract:
    We aim to constrain the chemo-dynamical properties of the Sagittarius
    (Sgr) dwarf galaxy using carbon abundances. At low metallicities in
    particular, these properties reveal the early chemical evolution of a
    system, tracing the contributing supernovae (SNe) and how much of
    their ejecta eventually made it into the next stellar generation. Our
    sample from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) includes ~350
    metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1.5) stars in the main body of Sgr with good
    quality spectroscopic observations. Our metalpoor Sgr population has a
    larger velocity dispersion than metal-rich Sgr from the literature,
    which could be explained by outside-in star formation, extreme
    Galactic tidal perturbations, and/or the presence of a metal-rich disc
    and bar + metal-poor halo. The average carbon abundance [C/Fe] in Sgr
    is similar to that of other classical dwarf galaxies (DGs) and
    consistently lower than in the Milky Way by ~0.2-0.3dex at low
    metallicities. The interstellar medium in DGs, including Sgr, may have
    retained yields from more energetic Population III and II supernovae
    (SNe), thereby reducing the average [C/Fe]. Additionally, SNe Ia
    producing more Fe than C would start to contribute at lower
    metallicity in DGs/Sgr than in the Galaxy. The presence of a [C/Fe]
    gradient for Sgr stars with [Fe/H]>~-2.0 (~6.8x10^-4^dex/ arcmin)
    suggests that SNe Ia contributed to the system at those metallicities,
    especially in its inner regions. There is a low frequency of
    carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in our Sgr sample. At higher
    metallicities and carbon abundances (i.e. mostly CEMPs), this may be
    due to photometric selection effects, but those are less likely to
    affect non-CEMP stars. Given the lower average [C/Fe] in DGs, we
    propose using the same CEMP definition ([C/Fe]>+0.7) as that applied
    to the Galaxy at large ends up underpredicting the number of CEMP
    stars in DGs. Burthermore, for Sgr, a cut at [C/Fe]~+0.35 may be more
    appropriate, which brings the frequency of CEMP stars in agreement
    with that of the whole Galaxy.

Description:
    The chemo-dynamical properties of the low-metallicity regime
    of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy are explored using the low- and
    medium-resolution AAT spectra observed by the Pristine Inner Galaxy
    Survey (PIGS). The PIGS dataset contains measurements of RVs, stellar
    parameters, [Fe/H], and [C/Fe] for stars towards the inner Galaxy and
    Sgr.
