There was an error in the paper, such that the log_eps(C) == A(C) values were off by 0.12 dex. This
is due to a mistake in Table 5, in which Ani Chiti calculated the log_eps(C) values using the 
Anders+1989 carbon solar abundance value of 8.55 dex (instead of the Asplund+2009carbon solar 
abundance value of 8.43 dex).

The discrepency between the two solar abundances was discussed in the paper while comparsing the data
being analyzed with another paper; however, the wrong value was used in the A(C) column. The correct 
[C/Fe] values were used in both Table 5 and Table 6, and throughout the rest of the analysis. The 
error only appears in the final creation of Table 5 in the paper.

Thus, I have manually changed the values in `table5.dat`, `table5.csv`, and `chiti2018_sculptor.csv`
to correct the values from this 0.12 dex discrepency. Comparing to the published paper, one will 
see the difference. The conversion of log_eps(C) to [C/Fe] using the Asplund+2009 
log_eps(C)_sun = 8.43 can also be used to check this work.

[C/Fe] = (epsc_star - epsc_sun) - [Fe/H]
epsc_star = [C/Fe] + epsc_sun + [Fe/H]
