Abstract:
    Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars bear important imprints of the
    early chemical enrichment of any stellar system. While these stars are
    known to exist in copious amounts in the Milky Way halo, detailed
    chemical abundance data from the faint dwarf spheroidal (dSph)
    satellites are still sparse, although the relative fraction of these
    stars increases with decreasing metallicity. Here, we report the
    abundance analysis of a metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-2.5dex),
    carbon-rich ([C/Fe]=1.4dex) star, ALW-8, in the Carina dSph
    using high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the ESO/UVES
    instrument. Its spectrum does not indicate any over-enhancements of
    neutron capture elements. Thus classified as a CEMP-no star, this is
    the first detection of this kind of star in Carina. Another of our
    sample stars, ALW-1, is shown to be a CEMP-s star, but its immediate
    binarity prompted us to discard it from a detailed analysis. The
    majority of the 18 chemical elements we measured are typical of
    Carina's field star population and also agree with CEMP stars in
    other dSph galaxies. Similar to the only known CEMP-no star in the
    Sculptor dSph and the weak-r-process star HD 122563, the lack of any
    strong barium-enhancement is accompanied by a moderate overabundance
    in yttrium, indicating a weak r-process activity. The overall
    abundance pattern confirms that, also in Carina, the formation site
    for CEMP-no stars has been affected by both faint supernovae and by
    standard core collapse supernovae. Whichever process was responsible
    for the heavy element production in ALW-8 must be a ubiquitous source
    to pollute the CEMP-no stars, acting independently of the environment
    such as in the Galactic halo or in dSphs.
