06/20/2022 XO: This directory was shared by Alex for analysis of GSE stars. This contains the S5 line lists for synthesis. They are generated by Alex's own version of linemake. 
Note from Alex: These are generated with my custom version of linemake. I think now the two are basically the same, but the key is that I replaced the Kurucz linelist with the Masseron linelist, and I added a few extra lines into goodgf to ensure the EQW and the synthesis lists were using the same atomic data.
See email correspondence with Alex on 06/20/2022 for details.
